+DONE+
- bug: diagonal movement
  - it was a floating point precision error. poked the player start position by 0.01
- bug: character being stuck
  - it was _isMoving never being cleared in some cases where we stop the coroutine on the moment of traversal (not 100% sure though, hard to repro)
- text being written animation
- additional room props
- bug: diagonal movement is still there
- bug: sometimes after down transition, the first movement moves two squares

+TODO+
- [WIP] bug: silly wonky-wonky movement when the player tries to leave the room right after entering it
- bug: the last message not seen in some cases
- win state (an actual one -- could think of something better)
- splash polish
- exclamation mark on text trigger
- character animations

+EXTRA+
- additional log text on floor
